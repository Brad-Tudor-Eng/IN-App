# IN!
> 
IN! is an incentive backed social events platform.  
Think of IN! as facebook events but with accountability.

Ever schedule a dinner only to haver the other person flake last minute?
Plan an event, put a bunch of money down reserving resources only to have half of the guest show?
We can't make your guest show up but, we can make them accountable for their actions.

## How's it work?

Sign up.
Create an event.
Specify date, time, location, a non-refundable base price, and a refundable incentive.
Invite people to the event.
If they show up on time, they get their incentive back.
If they don't show up, their incentive gets dispursed amongst those that showed up.
